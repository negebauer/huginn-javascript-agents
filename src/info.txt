The JavaScript Agent allows you to write code in JavaScript that can create and receive events. If other Agents aren’t meeting your needs, try this one!

You can put code in the code option, or put your code in a Credential and reference it from code with credential:<name> (recommended).

You can implement Agent.check and Agent.receive as you see fit. The following methods will be available on Agent in the JavaScript environment:

this.createEvent(payload)
this.incomingEvents() (the returned event objects will each have a payload property)
this.memory()
this.memory(key)
this.memory(keyToSet, valueToSet)
this.setMemory(object) (replaces the Agent’s memory with the provided object)
this.deleteKey(key) (deletes a key from memory and returns the value)
this.credential(name)
this.credential(name, valueToSet)
this.options()
this.options(key)
this.log(message)
this.error(message)
this.escapeHtml(htmlToEscape)
this.unescapeHtml(htmlToUnescape)
